# POWER_BI-PROJECT


  Power BI Practice Project: Sales & Profit Analysis

  
This project is a hands-on demonstration of my skills in building insightful, interactive dashboards using Power BI. It covers full-cycle BI reporting ‚Äî from data modeling to visual storytelling ‚Äî and was developed as part of my learning journey in data visualization and analytics.

üîß Techniques & Tools Used


Power Query (M) for data cleanup and shaping

Data modeling with proper relationships and cardinality

Visualizations using bar charts, treemaps, KPIs, slicers, and maps

DAX for calculated metrics and goals

Drill-downs, filters, and slicers for interactivity

üìÅ Dashboard Overview


1. Sales and Quantity Analysis by Region, Segment, and Product
Regional sales by sub-category

Segment-wise quantity distribution

Funnel chart to rank product performance

Filters for region and segment

2. Product and Geographic Sales Breakdown

Total bill amount by sub-category

State-wise sales visualized via treemap

Focus on geographic performance differences

3. Regional vs. Overall Product Sales Comparison

üí° What I Learned


Building layered dashboards with both summary and detailed views

Designing visuals for business storytelling and decision-making

Managing slicers and filters for cross-page interactions

Using DAX to calculate goals, percentages, and trends

‚úÖ Next Steps


I plan to:

Connect live data sources (SQL, Excel, Web)

Add row-level security (RLS) for user-specific views

Automate data refreshes and publish reports to Power BI Service
